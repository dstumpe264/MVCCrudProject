## MVC Crud Project(11/2017)
### David Stumpe AKA Lord Stumpicus
Description of my CRUD project and technologies I used for this project...
My project is designed to demonstrate what I've learned up to this point at Skill Distillery. In this project I demonstrate CRUD, Create, Retrieve, Update, Delete. 
Part 2 of this project demonstrates what I have learned about databases. Instead of individual warriors being created and instantiated through the program it's self and living in memory, they are now kept in a database. Using MySql query statements to pull them and store them. The WebApp now has CRUD functionality through a database. 
Disclosure: The dialogue of my web app is intended to be humorous, and is sort of an inside joke, I have no delusions of grandeur. It does not reflect my beliefs.  More explanation to come.
